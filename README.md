C++ code to demonstrate the speed up gained by using GPUs for Wilson-Dirac operator applications using OpenACC. Performed as part of the 2020 RPI Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Training for Modeling Physical Systems program

Planning on extending this to 4D LQCD and incorporating this into HMC gauge generation for small platform testing
